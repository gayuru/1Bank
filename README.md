## What problems lead us to make 1Bank ##
🌀 Too many bank accounts to handle<br>
😕 Unclear view of our banking tendencies<br>
🏷️ Banks only have a partial idea of a customer's spending habits<br>

## What inspired us 💡 ##

- This is possible by the new API that the australian governmnet going to release called <b>Open Banking</b>.

- Open banking centers on the idea that you deserve to have complete access to the consumer data that is collected by banks and financial institutions. More info: https://accntu.re/33BW3qa

## Built With ⚒️
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. <br>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
- [Figma](http://www.figma.com/) - Figma is an interface design application that runs in the browser–but it’s actually much more than that. I would go so far as to say it’s probably the best application for team-based collaborative design projects.
